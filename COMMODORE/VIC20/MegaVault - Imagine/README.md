This fantastic game featuring a Splash Screen and brilliant gameplay foxed me back in the day, it's now 2022, probably best find out what happens after level two!

I've created a couple of cheats that will work on both Emulators and Original Cassette if you're prepared to type-in the BASIC listing.

Enjoy!
