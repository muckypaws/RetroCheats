This game is a real PIA to automate the cheat process, not because of protection systems, just because of the way the game loads in various stages with embedded Assembler in BASIC Programs.

For now, if you're using an Emulator (I'm going to assume VICE - https://vice-emu.sourceforge.io )

Load and run the game as normal.  From the menu, select `File->Activate Monitor` or use the shortcut key.

Enter the following commands :-

`fill $1664 $1664 6`

`x`

Your next game will ensure the torch light doesn't extinguish.

I may revisit this and do a mega loader to automate it.
