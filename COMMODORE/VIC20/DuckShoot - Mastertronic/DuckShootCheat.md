Instructions are simple for this one.

Insert your Duck Shoot Cassette and type

`LOAD""`

**DO Not RUN The Program, Instead Type**

`LOAD""`

Again... Or you could fast forward the cassette to the main game.

Once loaded, type the following :-

Infinite Lives
--------------

`poke 4453, 96`

`poke 5332, 234`

`poke 5333, 234`

`poke 5334, 234`


Infinite Time
-------------

`poke 5408, 234`

`poke 5409, 234`

`poke 5410, 234`

`poke 5441, 5`


Finally Type `RUN`

I don't recommend using both cheats at the same time as the game will never end.
