Want to keep your respect and opinon of your employer on the shop-floor?

We got you!

Follow these instructions and never lose managements opinion when stuff gets nicked.

`LOAD""`

Now edit the following lines

`80 for x=0 to 26:read y:poke256+x,y:next`

`100 data 160,255,32,213,255`

`110 data 169,234,141,209,31`

`120 data 76,3,16`

Type `RUN` and now when items get stolen we got you covered fam!

Interestingly this game becomes faster as time goes by, I believe it's designed to not let you reach the end of your shift before failing as it's near impossible to catch the blighters!
