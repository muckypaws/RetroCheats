Found by Jason Brooks - www.muckypaws.com

To create infinite lives for this classic game, follow these instructions.

`LOAD""`

`LOAD""`,1,1

`LOAD""`

`78 fore=1to75:next E,I`

`155`

`RUN`

The game is written in a combination of BASIC and assembler, we're modifying the BASIC part of the game for the cheats.  

You need to delete LINE 155 if you're wanting infinite lives on the second part of the game, the snake like bank robbing section.

It's as simple as that!
