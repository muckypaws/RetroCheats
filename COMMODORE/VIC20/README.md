# MEGAVAULT - (C) Imagine 1984

This fantastic game featuring a Splash Screen and brilliant gameplay foxed me back in the day, it's now 2022, probably best find out what happens after level two!

I've created a couple of cheats that will work on both Emulators and Original Cassette if you're prepared to type-in the BASIC listing.

Enjoy!


## Files

MegaVault.bas 			= Type In Listing type this in and then insert the cassette.

MegaVaultCheat.tap		= TAP File you can load into an emulator.

MegaVaultCheat.asm		= Assembly Language of the Custom Header Built.
